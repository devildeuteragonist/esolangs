# esolangs
Long time no commit, huh? 
This is my small space for sharing code written in esoteric (programming) languages. I'm not sure if GitHub has any support for esolangs (seems that people have had to create  their own programmes to allow the platform to support them), but I would still like to try to put any small esolangs projects here. 

Because esolangs are, by defintition, intentionally obtuse, I don't expect to create anything long or complex. I'd still like to see what fun I can have with them, though. 

If you are a visitor here, and you do not know what an esolang is, here's the wiki article! https://esolangs.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language
